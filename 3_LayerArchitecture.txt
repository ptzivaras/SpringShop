1.API (Controller layer) – package api/
 -Exposes REST endpoints (@RestController).
 -Translates HTTP ↔ DTOs.

2.Service (Business layer) – package service/
 -Encapsulates business rules, transactions, orchestration.

3.Repository (Data access layer) – package repository/
 -Talks to the database via Spring Data JPA.

MVC mapping: In a SPA setup, the View lives in React (separate project). The backend holds the Model (entities/DTOs) and the Controller (REST). So:
M= domain/ entities (+DTOs)
V= React App
C= api/ controllers

This separation keeps the backend clean and testable, and the frontend free to evolve independently.

--What we got now?
React app = the UI (replaces ASP.NET MVC with Razor).
Spring Boot API = Controllers (API layer) + Services (business layer).
Repositories + Entities = Data access layer.
